<h1>James Bay - Let it go</h1>
<p>
		From walking home and talking loads <br> 
		to seeing shows in evening clothes with you<br> 
		from nervous touch to getting drunk <br>
		to staying up and waking up with you
	</p>
	
	<p>
		But now we're sleeping at the edge <br>
		Holding something we don't need <br>
		All this delusion in our heads <br>
		Is gonna bring us to our knees
	</p>
	
	<p class="Firstrow">
		So come on let it go<br>
		Just let it be<br>
		Why don't you be you<br>
		And I'll be me
	</p>
	
	<p class="Firstrow">
		Everything's that's broke<br>
		Leave it to the breeze<br>
		Why don't you be you<br>
		And I'll be me<br>
	</p>
